## PACMEN FACTORY

The project contains 2 files with code: pacmen.js and index.html

When button "make one" is pressed the code will trigger a factory to make one PacMan at a random position and with random velocity
to position the new pacman image and add it to the "game" div. 
It is then added to the array of pacmen, which keeps track of the position and velocity of each pacman.
Each pacman bounces off any wall it hits with the 'update' function, it loops over the array that stores the pacmen and move each image in the DOM.

Roadmap of future improvements: Adding more functionalities to the PacMen Factory like making the PacMen of different sizes and/or setting an exact path to follow for the PacMen and not just moving randomly through the browser.
